<!-- Index.html is a special name coz if a file name is index.html and its at the root directory of our folder the web 
    browser will think thats the home page of our website -->

<!-- HTML is a language which is used to define layouts for web-pages and we define those layouts using html tags -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This tag tells the web-browser this file is a html document-->

<!-- The above tag is a single tag but html has what are called container tags which contain either content or other html tags -->
<html>

<!-- Every html file has 2 parts the head and the body-->
<!-- The head tag contains all the settings and metadata about the file-->

    <head>
        <!-- title tag contains the title of the site -->
        <title>
            Mohit's Website
        </title>
    </head>

<!-- As we are defining these tags the web-browser is going to parse through all these different tags and figure out where 
    all the stuff goes-->


<!-- The body tag contains all the content of the file -->
<!-- So anything thats in the body is gonna show up or get rendered by the browser-->

    <body>
        Hello world
    </body>

</html>

<!-- / denotes that this tag is a closing tag -->
