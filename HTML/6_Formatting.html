            Tags to layout web pages : 
             
            1) <header>: can contain navigation menu

            2) <main>: meat and the bones of the website

            3) <footer> : additional navigation links
                
            A good practise while creating a website is seperating the content of the website into these tags
                
            <nav> : this tag is used to store navigational elements like navigation lists or links
        
            <article> : this tag can be used to store the articles of website
        
            <section> : these tags are used to break the content into sections and are usually used with articles to break 
                the article into section
        
            <aside> : this tag is used to show any information which is not directly related to the website for example 
                an ad
        
            These layout tags are not gonna change the look and the feel of the website rather they make the HTML file 
            more readible and make our website search engine optimized 

            These tags make our website better and more search engine favourable.
