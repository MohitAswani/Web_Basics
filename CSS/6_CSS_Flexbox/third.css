/*

FLEX PROPERTIES FOR CHILDREN/FLEX ITEMS :

1) order : controls the order in which the items appear.

By default every elements order is 0.

2) Align self : Allows the default alignment along the cross axis to be overridden for individual flex items.

But for this the elements must be counted as a single elements and hence the align-content must not be center.

3) flex-grows : used to set the width with respect to other elements in the container. along the flex-direction. 

But for this to work we must not set the width of the item.

4) flex-shrink : specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. Used when the items are overflowing from flex-container.
